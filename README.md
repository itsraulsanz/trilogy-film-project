# Project Outline

Assignment 6 - Thom Williams: Weather Dashboard

Completed task for week 6 of the University of Manchester Coding Bootcamp course.

Weather Dashboard app created using third party APIs. The app makes requests to the Open Weather API with specific paramters and generates weather forecast statistics for a city searched for by the user. It displays a detailed outlook of the weather conditions for today, and a sumamry outlook for the weather over the next 5 days.

Weather Icons visually display the forecast summary. The UV index is color coded depending on weather the UV levels are favourable, moderate, or severe.

The weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

'localStorage'saves the user's search history, so they can view the outlook again once the result is clicked again. 

There is enhanced functionality and styling from css frameworks Bootstrap and Google Fonts. The UI has been designed with a clean, polished, and accessible interface designed for mobile and desktop.

## Features

An interactive Weather Dashboard that retrieves data from the Open Weather API. It runs in the browser and is powered by HTML, CSS and Javascript, and enhanced by third party CSS frameworks including Bootstrap and Google Fonts.

Key Features include: 

* User inputs the name of the city and the dashboard dynamically generates the weather forcast.
* The main "Current Weather" window retrieves data from the current weather API call and displays a more detailed outlook for today's date. 
* Current Weather generates data including an icon representive of the weather conditions, the temperature in degrees centigrade, the humidity, the wind speed in MPH, and the UV index. 
* The UV Index cross references data retrieved from the UV Index API. The data is colour coded according to weather conditions are favourable (green), moderate (yellow), or severe (red) based on the EPA's official guidelines.  
* The 5 Day Weather Forecast is also displayed, making a call to the 5 Day Data API. 
* Dynamically generating a series of 5 cards representative of the next 5 days, they each display the date, the predicted temperature, the humidity and display a icon representation of the weather conditions.
* Using localStorage, the user's search history is saved. The dynamically created elements once clicked will bring up the weather forecast for that city again.
* Font styles enhanced by Google Fonts API.
* It has a clean, simple, accessible and user-friendly design 
* Mobile responsive design enhanced by bootstrap layouts.
